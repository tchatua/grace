# Introduction to AZs and Regions

- **Availability Zones** and **Regions** are the **core components** within AWS that **allow for fault isolation**.
- The AWS global infrastructure is made up of multiple geographic regions spread around the world. 
- They are connected via high-speed networking but are independent.
- An AWS region is made up of multiple Availability Zones. 
- These Availability Zones allow for fault isolation within a region and provide the simplest way to achieve a significant level of redundancy.

## Lab Objectives
- Build on the AWS global infrastructure
- Take advantage of the multiple availability options AWS provides
- Build multiple AWS VPCs to suit requirements
- Create custom isolated networks to meet business needs
