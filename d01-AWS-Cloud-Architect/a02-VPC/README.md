# Virtual Private Cloud

## To create a VPC:
- click the "**Create VPC**" button on the VPC service dashboard.
- There are two options I can choose from: 
  - creating only a VPC 
  - or creating a VPC and more.
- I'll choose the "**VPC and more**" option, 
  - I'll explore what I can do, 
  - and then create it. 
  - I do not need to create a *NAT gateway*, as there is a charge for them.
